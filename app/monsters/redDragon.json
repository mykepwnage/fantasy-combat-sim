They are supremely confident of their own abilities and are prone to making snap decisions without any forethought. The most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons breathe a cone of fire.[1]Red Dragons are the most fearsome and cruel of the chromatic dragons. They delight in ruin, death, and destruction.",
